# StaySafe

### TODO
- Notify (that I am testing positive) by sharing your check-in history
- Publish to FlightCentre
- Push Notifications to be working with custom script
- Onboarding
- Designs

### Nice to have
- checkin off network and sync back when online
- Custom QR Code to merge App icon
- analytics
- crashlytics
- security by adding grace period of 1 min between checkins
- security by checking if the user actually close in proximity to the QR code
- App Store publisher name to be iProgram than my personal name

### Bugs
- QR Print crashes
- QR screenshot at dark mode makes it white background which needs to make the labels contrasting to black!
- Search Done button is not working
- Search x button is not clearing the result
- Search is not showing the list from closest to me (reigon)
